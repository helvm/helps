# ✔️TODO

**Planned features.**

## Haskell compilers:
### Self parser:
* [ ] Migrate [mini haskell](https://github.com/helvm/mini-haskell) - A compiler for a subset of Haskell to Combinatory Logic, use TypeClass
* [ ] Migrate [Compiler Quest](https://github.com/helvm/compiler) - Self hosted compiler 
* [ ] Migrate [Mini-Haskell Project](https://github.com/helvm/Mini-Haskell-jasonhongxyz) - A "Mini-Haskell" functional programming language
* [ ] Migrate [prelude from PureScript](https://github.com/purescript/purescript-prelude) 
* [ ] Check other things from https://crypto.stanford.edu/~blynn/compiler/

### Parsec:
* [ ] Migrate [Haskell to Lazy K compiler](https://github.com/helvm/hs2blc) - use Stream, not IO
* [ ] Migrate [Duet](https://github.com/helvm/duet) - A tiny language, a subset of Haskell (with type classes) aimed at aiding teachers teach Haskell
* [ ] Migrate [helium](https://github.com/helvm/helium) and LVM - small educable compiler

### External Haskell parser:
* [ ] Migrate [hs2bf](https://github.com/helvm/hs2bf) - very easy, use external parser for Haskell98
* [ ] Migrate [Fay](https://github.com/helvm/fay) - A proper subset of Haskell that compiles to JavaScript.
* [ ] Migrate HscMain - it is possible tu fork GHC?

## Other compilers:
* [ ] Migrate [PureScript Language CST Parser](https://github.com/helvm/purescript-language-cst-parser)
* [ ] Migrate [PureScript compiler written in PureScript](https://github.com/helvm/purescript-in-purescript)

## Utils and tutorials:
* [ ] Migrate [Typing Haskell in Haskell](https://github.com/helvm/thih) - partially used by hs2lazyk
* [ ] Migrate [Poly](https://github.com/helvm/write-you-a-haskell/tree/master/chapter7)
* [ ] Migrate [ProtoHaskell](https://github.com/helvm/write-you-a-haskell/tree/master/chapter8)
* [ ] Migrate [Let's Build a Compiler (in Haskell)](https://github.com/helvm/cradle)
* [ ] Migrate [Types and Programming Languages](https://github.com/helvm/haskell-tapl)
* [ ] Use [hint](https://github.com/helvm/hint) - A Haskell interpreter built on top of the GHC API

You can propose feature by [GitHub](https://github.com/helvm/helps/issues).
