**HelPS** was inspired by many resources:
* [Compiler Quest](https://github.com/blynn/compiler) - main inspiration
* [A compiler for a subset of Haskell to Combinatory Logic](https://github.com/siraben/mini-haskell) - very simply, working case from Compiler Quest
* [hs2lazy -- Haskell to Lazy K compiler](https://github.com/tromp/hs2blc)
* [hs2bf - Haskell to brainfuck compiler](https://github.com/xanxys/hs2bf)
